            "**Within the mitochondrial intermembrane space:**  MtCK catalyzes the reversible transfer of a\n",

            "(adenosine diphosphate).  This reaction essentially \"stores\" the high-energy phosphate bond of ATP\n",
            "in the readily diffusible PCr molecule.  2. **Coupling with Oxidative Phosphorylation:**  This\n",
            "process is tightly coupled with oxidative phosphorylation, the primary means of ATP production in\n",
            "the mitochondria.  The ADP produced by mtCK is readily available to the ATP synthase complex,\n",
            "stimulating oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production.  This creates a streamlined energy\n",
            "transfer system.  3. **Creatine/PCr Shuttle:** The PCr generated by mtCK can then diffuse out of the\n",
            "mitochondria and into the cytosol, particularly to energy-consuming sites like myofibrils in muscle\n",
            "cells or nerve terminals.  At these locations, a cytosolic isoform of creatine kinase catalyzes the\n",
            "reverse reaction, regenerating ATP from PCr and providing energy for cellular work.  This creates\n",
            "what's known as the creatine/PCr shuttle.  4. **Voltage-Dependent anion channel (VDAC)\n",
            "involvement:**  The function of mtCK is closely linked to the activity of the VDAC located in the\n",
            "outer mitochondrial membrane.  VDAC facilitates the transport of ADP and ATP across the outer\n",
