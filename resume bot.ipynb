            "* **Disorganized and unprofessional formatting:**  The resume lacks a clear structure, making it difficult to read and understand.  Information is scattered and not presented in a logical order.\n",
            "* **Inconsistent formatting and capitalization:** Inconsistent use of capitalization, bolding, and spacing creates a messy appearance.\n",
            "* **Lack of quantifiable achievements:** While the resume lists activities and experiences, it lacks quantifiable achievements that demonstrate impact.  For example, instead of just mentioning cleaning campaigns, quantify the impact (e.g., \"Organized and led cleaning campaigns that resulted in a 20% reduction in campus litter\").\n",
            "* **Weak \"About Me\" section:**  The \"About Me\" is too brief and generic. It doesn't highlight unique skills or career goals.\n",

            "3. **Use bullet points:**  Use bullet points to list accomplishments and responsibilities under each experience.\n",
            "4. **Quantify achievements:** Use numbers and data to showcase the impact of your work.\n",
            "5. **Prioritize relevant information:**  Place the most important and relevant information at the top of the resume.\n",
            "6. **Tailor the resume:**  Customize the resume for each specific job application, highlighting the skills and experiences that are most relevant to the role.\n",

Mention the specific type of role you are seeking (e.g., Research Assistant, Lab Technician).\n",
            "* **Expand on laboratory experience:** Provide more detail about each technique and the specific projects you worked on.  Quantify your contributions whenever possible.  Consider restructuring this section into \"Projects\" and detailing specific research or lab projects.\n",
            "* **Remove unnecessary details:**  Remove details like \"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India\" next to your contact information.  Your phone number already indicates your location.  The Olympiads can be briefly mentioned but shouldn't be a focal point.\n",
            "* **Reorganize \"Extracurricular Activities\":**  Present these activities more concisely and focus on leadership roles or significant achievements.\n",
            "* **Create a \"Skills\" section:** List your technical skills (e.g., Python, specific laboratory techniques, software) and soft skills (e.g., teamwork, communication, problem-solving).\n",
